# User Story (Story Points = Medüëï)
**As a** end user of a `NodeJs` Occasion and gift tracker application  

**I want** use the application on the web and mobile devices [like this one](https://super-duper-hepta-journey.herokuapp.com/) üëç

**So That** I don't have to use sticky notes, third party calendar apps, and paper notes to keep of birthdays, wedding anniversaries, and other important dates and the gifts supplied for these events.

## Comments/Steps to implement ü•á
**##Disclaimer**  The steps and procedures in this project were performed using **`Visual Studio Code`**, **`NodeJS`**, **`Express`** web framework, and **`Mongodb`**.  For data dependencies, library, and coding editing choose any environment you are most comfortable and familiar with.

### Setup Nodejs and Express and Mongodb:
- Install **`Nodejs`** [from here]( https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your local developer environment.  
-  Install and setup **`Express`** [from here]( https://github.com/04banshee/Dev-Training-Lab-ALPHA). The steps and procedures are the same for this project.
- Install **`Mongodb`**.  In a **`vsCode`** terminal use the command **`npm install mongodb -- save`**.  This will install the mongodb so you can use it in your project.  To verify mongodb installed correctly use the command **`npm mongodb --version`**.  Below is a screen shot if mongodb install correctly.

### Create Project in Visual Code(vsCode):
- To create the project open **`vsCode`** and start a new project.  Detailed steps on how to start a new in **`vsCode`**  [cand be found here]( https://github.com/04banshee/Dev-Training-Lab-ALPHA). Refer to the section titled **"Create Project in Visual Code"**.
- Create a **`Mongodb Atlas`** cloud account to store and save persistent data to.  Use [this tutorial]( https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/create-atlas-account/) to create the account. 
- To familiarize yourself with the Atlas environment use [this tutorial]( https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/).  It has all the necessary information to create a new account, deploy a cluster, add connections to your database etc.  

## Connecting to Mongo Atlas
- There are two options to connect to the **`Mongo Atlas`** cluster. 
    - Option 1.  Download [Compass]( https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) app for **`Mongodb`**. 
    - Option 2.  Login to the [Atlas]( https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try2?utm_source=bing&utm_campaign=mdb_bs_americas_united_states_search_core_brand_atlas_desktop&utm_term=atlas%20mongodb&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=415204521&msclkid=33b4ee957331158595db8f1ff0349636) web portal.  
-  Both options are a GUI interface, and have all interactive features that allow you to manage and update your mongodb instance.


### Code the app:
- Show snipets of the code and how it works, programing language ect.


## Test app locally:
- Explain how to test the app locally.  Test for bugs, programing logical errors ect.


### Deploy App to persistent URL
- Deploy app to persistent URL for use and more testing.  

### How to know when you are done. Acceptance Criteria 
- State criteria for user satisfaction and app functional use.



## **Developers Notes:**
- Put in any additional notes that will help developer explain their process and way of thinking for the app (1000 foot view!!)
