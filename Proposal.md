## Main Idea:
Develop a full stack application that stores, reminds, and catalogs birthdays, wedding anniversaries, and other important dates/events and records the gifts associated with the event.  <a href="#Table-of-contents"><p align="right">Return to the top</p></a>

## Overview:
There are many calendar applications on the market that provide similar functionality.  The capabilities and functionality of these applications do not provide a way for the user to catalog events into a database and retrieve them according to occasion or supplied gift for the event.  This application will allow the user to see what gift was supplied and the categories of events over multiple year time span.

## Background:
People use technology daily to help with mundane simple tasks that are often overlooked or forgotten.  Forgetting a birthday, or wedding anniversary can create friction in a relationships, cause family ties to be severed and possibly end a relationship.  Having an application that helps keep track of these important dates provides the freedom of focusing on the gift and making it more meaningful.

The concept of reminders applications in not new but, it is an emerging market for development.  This approach provides an innovative way to let a person know you are thinking about them, care and love them.

## Objectives:
1. Developing a front end web interface a user can interact with.
1. Processing and persistently storing data to a backend database.
1. Retrieving and updating the persistent storage datasets as a user interacts with the web interface

## Scope:
This will be an operational prototype of birthday and gift tracker application.  The application will be an interactive web application that allows user input, storage, and data retrieval.  The application will interact with a Mongo DB.  The Mongo DB will be a persistent storage device for creation, retrieval,  updating, and deleting (CRUD) operations.  Other functional iterations of the application will be possible for future development.

## Development:

### Architecture
For this objective, the idea is to build a functional application that provides a web API with a persistent server side database.  To accomplish this, the interface will be built with HTML, CSS and some `JavaScript`.  Using these technologies allows for rapid Agile development.  The interface will be simple but intuitive, so the user does not have to learn a process to use the application.  In addition, the front end application will have `AngularJS` included for data binding,  dependency injection, and elimination  of code duplication.  All of this happens in the browser which makes `AngularJs` ideal for any dynamic webpage and server technology.  See more of what [`AngularJs`](https://angular.io/) can do

## View:
To better understand the data, and how it will be processed we are providing a visual representation of frontend of our project, backend and how the data will be rendered while processing through the full stack.

The purpose of this view is to provide a visual representation of the layout and data flow.

## Opportunities and challenges:
With our lifestyles becoming more hectic than ever, it’s increasingly difficult for most of us to juggle our professional and personal lives. One moment you’re trying to meet an impossible deadline at work, and the next, you’re running errands for your home.  In addition to the juggling of many tasks all these task must be centrally located and accessible constantly while on the job, or while traveling with family and friends.  Having an app that handles the time consuming scheduling is another stressor you need not worry about.  Like any technology there are challenges that must be considered.  Privacy is at the front of all of our minds.  The information the application will store is very sensitive and must be stored safely and with personal privacy in mind.

## Conclusions:
As we can see, blockchain operating systems offer us a full bunch of software by taking advantage of all of the overall blockchain concepts, allowing the integration of the current and future Blockchain Ecosystem on a single operating system platform. The efficiency, reliability, privacy and security are key values of this highly new approach of interacting with computer systems.

The implementation of this technology in a current operating system is not simple, since it would have to be integrated with its kernel to record the tasks that users perform in it. On the other hand, its complete development is quite complex, since new technologies have to be integrated with the basic principles to create a completely new operating logic. In both cases, a large investment of resources is required. However, this first theoretical and practical approach was very compelling to learn the basics of Blockchain concepts and its integration with the entire technological ecosystem that surrounds it. 

The contemporary trends of commerce will force us to adapt new ways to do things, but we must be cautious of how our data is managed by understanding, even a little, the way all of it works. It’s clear that this is just a very important checkpoint in the race to develop highly advanced technology that will capitalize and empower the digital world towards revolutionary horizons.
