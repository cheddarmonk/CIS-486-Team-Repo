## Main idea
Develope a full stack application that stores, reminds, and cataloges birthdays, wedding anniversaries, and other important dates and events and the gifts associated with the evetn.  <a href="#Table-of-contents"><p align="right">Return to the top</p></a>

## Overview:
There are many calendar applications on the market that provide similar functionality.  The capabilites and functions of these applications do not provide a way for the user to catalog events into a database and retrive them according to occacion, or supplied gift for for the event.  This application will allow the user to see what gift was supplied, categories of events over multiple year time span.

## Background:
People use technology on a daily basis to help with mundane simple tasks that are often over looked or forgotten.  Forgetting your loved ones birthday, or wedding anniversary can create friction in a relationship and possibly fracture and end the relationship.  Having an application that will remind you of these important dates gives you the freedom of not focusing on the life event date, but more importantly allows you to focus on the gift.

The concept of reminders in not new and dynamic but it is an emerging market for development.  It provides an innovative ways to let a person know you are thinking about them, care and love them.

## Objectives:
Demonstrate the development of a full stack application is possible by:
1. Developing a front end web interface the user can interact with.
1. Processing and persistantly storing data to a backend database.
1. Retriving and updating the persistent storage datasets as a user interacts with the web interface..

## Scope:
This will only be an operational prototype of birthday and gift tracker.  The application will have a web interface the user can input categories, dates, personal messages, and remarks section.  The application will interact with a Mongo DB  as the persistent for data retrival and updating.  Other fuctional interactions of the application will be possible for future development.

## Development:

### Architecture
For the purpose of our objective, the idea is to build a prototype application that visually resembles a command line, but internally can actually access the resources of this, behaving as such and being able to perform the same operations as if it were running natively within the operating system.

Therefore, our application to be developed will be based on Electron, which is a multiprocess and multiplatform architecture framework to create desktop applications using web technologies. Electron integrates Node.js to access the system resources in the backend, and the Chromium browser to build the frontend. With this, we are able to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to customize what is displayed to the user. 

Since Electron is in charge of integrating the backend and the frontend in a single architecture, we will have two important processes. The `main` and the `renderer`. The first one controls the state of the application while the second one controls the interface with the user. When an Electron application is executed, the `main` process is launched, which is in charge of accessing the system resources and starting the `renderer` process. An important point to mention is that the `main` process does not have direct access to frontend methods and resources.

Summarizing the above, the `main` process can be seen as a browser, and the `renderer` process as one of its tabs.

## View:
To obtain a more user-friendly view of the data, we will add to the frontend of our project the template provided for the original prototype. This new view will be used for data audit type review, so we will call it Audit Page. 

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88801826/133298975-2d4fa221-79c5-4610-ab5e-5b9776819bf3.png">
</p>

The purpose of this view is to inspect the number of commands that each user has performed through its search.

What we want is to be shown who executed it, to which service, the number and the command in question.  Although we have a great base to be able to display such information, it is necessary to make some small changes:

First we must obtain the information from the source, that is, from the `blockchain.js` file via `app.js`. The balance is already given, only that, as each transaction is assigned a value of 1, we need the balance to be positive. On the other hand, we are also interested in the command of that transaction. All these instructions are in the `getAddressData` method of the prototype. We apply the following changes.


## Oportunities and challenges:
In recent years, the issue of data security and privacy has become very important. It is so important that governments have implemented specific policies for its control and management. Platforms are required to protect the integrity of users' information and to provide them with security certainty. 

The digital commerce boom has also been impressive in recent decades. Today, most transactions are carried out digitally, so the applications and platforms used for this purpose must have excellent security for its operation, in addition to providing efficient management for both customers and companies.

While a blockchain operating system would offer many unequivocal advantages in terms of these last points, the truth is that its implementation and integration would not be so easy for three reasons: the change culture, the cost and the market.

We are currently so used to traditional operating systems that adopting another one would be somewhat uncomfortable, and many of the productive applications we use today would also have to be migrated to the new platform in order to continue to be used. And even if the functionality of the blockchain operating system were the same as any other traditional operating system, we would still have reservations about its security and stability, especially for applications with a large-scale deployment.

An important and paradoxical point at this point is who can access the system's transaction information, i.e., the privacy of the user's actions. The default system would offer a great level of detail of the movements made. Is this valid? There are conflicting opinions: on the one hand, there are those who defend data transparency, on the other hand there are those who fight for strict privacy. It is a question whose answer will undoubtedly generate a great deal of debate on this point. My comment would be in relation to good data management for purposes previously established and agreed upon by all parties involved; it is proven that Blockchain technology does offer data protection through highly secure and effective algorithms.

The second factor is cost. The infrastructure required to support the operations of a blockchain operating system is very expensive, as supporting all its complex operations requires a lot of processing power and storage. Not all companies could afford the transition. Moreover, it also leads to a lot of investment in addition to the monetary one. To learn a new operating system requires a knowledge base deep enough to give certainty about its correct operation, and this, paradoxically, happens when users are completely immersed in it without knowing enough yet. Human resources and their training remain essential at this point.


## Conclusions:
As we can see, blockchain operating systems offer us a full bunch of software by taking advantage of all of the overall blockchain concepts, allowing the integration of the current and future Blockchain Ecosystem on a single operating system platform. The efficiency, reliability, privacy and security are key values of this highly new approach of interacting with computer systems.

The implementation of this technology in a current operating system is not simple, since it would have to be integrated with its kernel to record the tasks that users perform in it. On the other hand, its complete development is quite complex, since new technologies have to be integrated with the basic principles to create a completely new operating logic. In both cases, a large investment of resources is required. However, this first theoretical and practical approach was very compelling to learn the basics of Blockchain concepts and its integration with the entire technological ecosystem that surrounds it. 

The contemporary trends of commerce will force us to adapt new ways to do things, but we must be cautious of how our data is managed by understanding, even a little, the way all of it works. Itâ€™s clear that this is just a very important checkpoint in the race to develop highly advanced technology that will capitalize and empower the digital world towards revolutionary horizons.
